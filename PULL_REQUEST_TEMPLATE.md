**IMPORTANT: Please do not create a Pull Request adding a new feature without discussing it first.**

The place to discuss new features is the forum: <https://zola.discourse.group/>
If you want to add a new feature, please open a thread there first in the feature requests section.

Sanity check:

* [ ] Have you checked to ensure there aren't other open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/getzola/zola/pulls) for the same update/change?

## Code changes
(Delete or ignore this section for documentation changes)

* [ ] Are you doing the PR on the `next` branch?

If the change is a new feature or adding to/changing an existing one:

* [ ] Have you created/updated the relevant documentation page(s)?
